Concept:
counting the collsions bewtween the block1 with higher mass and block2; counter shows the x first digits of pi

mass(block1) = 1, mass(block2) = 1  => 3                                                                                                   
mass(block1) = 100, mass(block2) = 1  => 31                                                                                               
mass(block1) = 10000, mass(block2) = 1  => 314                                                                                             
mass(block1) = 1000000, mass(block2) = 1  => 3141
